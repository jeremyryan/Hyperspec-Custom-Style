Hyperspec-Custom-Style
======================

Just a few things to make reading the hyperspec a little nicer experience.

Contains the following parts:
* HyperSpec.css: Add as a userstyle for sites hosting the hyperspec. By default it is scoped to localhost and [www.lispworks.com](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm).
* HyperSpec.user.js: A userscript which uses jQuery UI to add tooltips for glossary terms.
